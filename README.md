Usurper
=======

Usurper detects every screenshot taken by OSX and uploads them
to POMF-like services as uguu.se and jii.moe.

A system notification will update you about the status of the
uploading process and finally the screenshot URL will be copied
into the clipboard.

Usage
-----

`$ swift usurper.swift`
